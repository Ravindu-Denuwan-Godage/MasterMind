Definition of Computer Viruses
------------------------------------
A computer virus is a type of malicious software, or malware, that spreads between computers and causes damage to data and software. 

Computer viruses aim to disrupt systems, cause major operational issues, and result in data loss and leakage. A key thing to know about computer viruses is that they are designed to spread across programs and systems. Computer viruses typically attach to an executable host file, which results in their viral codes executing when a file is opened. The code then spreads from the document or software it is attached to via networks, drives, file-sharing programs, or infected email attachments.


Common Signs of Computer Viruses
----------------------------------
A computer virus will more than likely have an adverse effect on the device it resides on and may be discoverable through common signs of performance loss, including:


Speed of System
-----------------------
A computer system running slower than usual is one of the most common signs that the device has a virus. This includes the system itself running slowly, as well as applications and internet speed suffering. If a computer does not have powerful applications or programs installed and is running slowly, then it may be a sign it is infected with a virus.


Pop-up Windows
------------------------
Unwanted pop-up windows appearing on a computer or in a web browser are a telltale sign of a computer virus. Unwanted pop-ups are a sign of malware, viruses, or spyware affecting a device.
